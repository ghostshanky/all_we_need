OpenRouter is a unified API platform that lets you access hundreds (400+) of AI models from many providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and others) via a single, consistent endpoint. It handles provider routing, fallbacks for higher availability, and exposes model-level pricing so you can choose speed vs. cost trade-offs.

One API, many models — call different chat/completion/vision models with the same API shape instead of juggling many provider keys.

Transparent pricing & per-model costs — model pricing is shown in the UI/docs so you can compare cost per token or per request.

Routing & high availability — OpenRouter can route requests to different providers and fall back automatically if a provider is unavailable.

Integrations & ecosystem — provider support exists across SDKs, community integrations (examples, Laravel, Vercel/AI SDK provider) and official docs/GitHub.
