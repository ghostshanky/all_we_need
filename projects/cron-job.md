## Overview
**cron-job.org** is a free service that allows you to execute scheduled tasks (cron jobs) via HTTP requests. It's an essential tool for developers who need reliable scheduling without managing their own server infrastructure.

> [!TIP]
> **Prevent App Sleeping**: Many free hosting providers (like Render, Glitch, or Replit) put your app to "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can use cron-job.org to send a request to your app every 10 minutes, ensuring it stays active and responsive 24/7.
