Antigravity is a powerful AI agent IDE that pairs with developers to build, debug, and refine software. It integrates deeply with your local environment to plan, execute, and verify complex coding workflows autonomously. 
Google Antigravity is currently free for individual developers during its public preview, offering unlimited AI-powered coding features, tab completions, and access to models like Gemini 3 Pro, but this is a temporary preview, and future enterprise or heavy usage might involve costs.
